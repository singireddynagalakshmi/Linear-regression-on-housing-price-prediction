Housing Price Prediction with Linear Regression
This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression to predict housing prices based on various features using the housing.csv dataset. The dataset includes various attributes of houses, such as the number of rooms, location, lot size, and other features, which serve as predictors in estimating the housing price. This project is designed to help understand and apply machine learning techniques for regression problems.

Overview
In this project, we use the housing.csv dataset to predict housing prices. This regression problem is tackled using the Linear Regression algorithm, one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms for prediction tasks. By training a Linear Regression model on the dataset, we aim to build a predictive model capable of estimating the price of a house based on given features.

Dataset
The housing.csv dataset contains information on various properties of houses, including:

Features: number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, lot size, etc.
Target: the price of the house.
Source
The dataset is included in the project and should be located in the root directory as housing.csv.

Dependencies
This project requires the following libraries:

Python 3.x
NumPy - for numerical computations.
Pandas - for data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn - for building and evaluating the Linear Regression model.
Matplotlib/Seaborn - for data visualization (optional, for exploratory data analysis).
To install dependencies, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Handle any missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
Feature Engineering: Identify and select relevant features. Convert categorical variables to numerical if necessary.
Feature Scaling: Standardize or normalize features for better model performance.
Model Training and Evaluation
The Linear Regression model is trained using the preprocessed dataset. The following metrics are used for evaluation:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R-Squared (R²)
These metrics provide insights into the accuracy of the model's predictions.

Results
The model’s performance metrics will be available after training. Additionally, visualization of actual vs. predicted prices may be plotted to evaluate prediction quality.

Usage
To run this project:

Clone this repository.
Ensure the housing.csv file is in the project directory.
Execute the script:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
